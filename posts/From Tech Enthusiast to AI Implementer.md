# From Tech Enthusiast to AI Implementer

I am writing from the perspective of a tech enthusiast. AI was always in the back of my mind. ML was all the rage. I remember, years after hearing so much about it, trying it for the first time using some Python—it felt magical. But, kind of like when I couldn’t stop hearing about neural networks, I couldn’t really put my finger on how these technologies would change our day-to-day lives in the near term. It always felt like this was something for the future, and the incremental changes would only compound once we were older.

**OpenAI's ChatGPT using GPT-3 was a leap.** But I’m sure the average tech enthusiast felt the same: a lot of excitement and then neglect. There were too many hallucinations, too many limitations—it was really only good at a handful of tasks, and it didn’t do them consistently.

The models have improved over the past years, and they can definitely do more things better, but until recently, I felt they lacked real-world implementations. Join me on my small journey of making useful and easy AI that can really help everyday people. Most of what I will go through requires **literally no technical skills**, while some solutions might require a bit of code.
